Instagram Follow Data Analyzer
Author: Shirlye Chen
Description: This script compares a user's Instagram followers and followings
             using JSON files exported from Instagram. It identifies mutuals,
             fans (followers not followed back), and people not following back.
Input: followers_1.json and following.json located in subdirectories under a given folder.
Output: follow_analysis.txt written to the same folder as the data.
